We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the reviewers for their constructive feedback. To support the comprehensive experimental analysis presented in our revised manuscript and response, we have updated this repository to include the detailed implementation of our proposed method, RTFSyn, ensuring full transparency regarding our model architecture and training details. We hope these resources facilitate the verification and assessment of our work. 😄
