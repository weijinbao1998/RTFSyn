# Refine Then Fusion: A Robust 3D Brain MRI Synthesis via Vision–Language Collaboration

We sincerely thank you for your constructive feedback. To support the clarifications provided in our **One-Page Response** and comprehensively address concerns regarding **reproducibility**, we have updated this repository to include the full source code for our method, **RTFSyn**, alongside the implementations of all reviewer-requested baselines (GuideGen, Report2CT, Text2CT, LG-WDM) under a unified protocol. Furthermore, we have enforced a deterministic setup by fixing random seeds throughout the pipeline to guarantee consistent and reproducible results. We hope these resources facilitate your verification and assessment. 😄
